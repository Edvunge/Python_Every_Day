# Strings are created with " or '
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'

# Strings can be added too
"Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"
# String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+'
"Hello " "world!"    # => "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"Hello world!"[0]  # => 'H'

# You can find the length of a string
len("This is a string")  # => 16

# Since Python 3.6, you can use f-strings or formatted string literals.
name = "Reiko"
f"She said her name is {name}." # => "She said her name is Reiko"
# Any valid Python expression inside these braces is returned to the string.
f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long."

# None is an object
None  # => None

# Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None
# Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
"etc" is None  # => False
None is None   # => True
